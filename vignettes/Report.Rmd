## R Markdown
 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
You need a working pandoc installation on your computer (this should be taken care of if you have an RStudio installation)


```{r load_data_and_packages, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (file.exists("../_targets")) {
  targets::tar_config_set("store" = "../_targets")
}
targets::tar_load(summary_data)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Road casualty data

We can present a visual display of the number of road casualties as follows:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = casualty_severity, y = Casualties,
    fill = casualty_severity
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Severity of Casualty") +
  ylab("Number of reported and sub-sampled casualties") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of reported pedestrian road casualties in 2023",
    subtitle = "All fatalities, 10% of serious and 1% of slight casualties",
    caption = "Source: STATs19, data.gov.uk"
  )
```

Do note that there has been a lot of sub-sampling. All fatally injured road pedestrian casualties are included in the data, but 10% of serious and 1% of slight casualties were selected at random.
